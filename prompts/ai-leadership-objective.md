# AI Leadership Reading Objective

Context:
I am developing into an AI and Security leader within my organization. 
I focus on:
- AI safety and governance
- Secure model deployment (Azure, MCP, Windmill)
- SOC automation and detection engineering
- AI attack surfaces, red-teaming, evals
- LLM architecture and local/cloud hybrid deployments
- Building internal AI assistants for analysts

Goal:
Translate weekly reading into insights that help me:
1. Improve as an AI security leader
2. Understand safe deployment patterns for LLMs
3. Identify attack trends + mitigations
4. Build stronger enterprise AI platforms
5. Mentor teams and advise decision-makers
6. Spot opportunities for automation
7. Strengthen long-term strategic judgment

For each URL:
1. Short summary (1–2 sentences)
2. Relevance to my goals
3. 3 strategic takeaways
4. Action I should take (implementation-oriented)

After all URLs:
- Meta-synthesis of the week: themes, shifts, patterns
- What I should learn next
- Blind spots I may not realize I have

Tone:
Executive. Clear. Strategic. Zero fluff.
